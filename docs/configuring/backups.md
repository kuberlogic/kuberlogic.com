:::caution
Backups will only work if you use CSI based volumes. Backups will not work for `hostPath` volumes.
:::

Backups and restores feature is provided via [Velero](https://velero.io) integration. Both file-based and volume snapshot based backups are supported.
Backups and restores are disabled by default. Follow these steps to configure environment and enable backup feature:

1. Get supported Velero release (follow the [steps](https://velero.io/docs/v1.9/basic-install/) from the official Velero website)

2. Install Velero for your [infrastructure provider](https://velero.io/docs/v1.9/supported-providers/). Make sure to include `--use-restic` to enable file based backups.

:::tip

If you're evaluating KuberLogic and do not want to use cloud resources, you can install Velero with local S3 compatible storage: [see here](https://velero.io/docs/main/contributions/minio/)

:::

3. Verify Velero status.
